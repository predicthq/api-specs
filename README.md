# PredictHQ OpenAPI Specifications

This repository contains the [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specifications for [PredictHQ's public APIs](https://docs.predicthq.com/).

## Overview

We use the OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification format to describe our APIs. This repo includes schemas, request/response examples, and reusable components.

## Limitations

- The OpenAPI specs do not yet cover all our APIs. We are working on adding more endpoints.

## Contributing

If you've identified a mismatch between PredictHQ APIs behavior and these specs, or found an issue with the format of a schema, please open an issue.
