        Remember this is a PUT endpoint which means you must provide all supported fields or you may lose data - you are
        effectively replacing the existing record with a new record containing all the fields you provide.
        We recommend first getting the existing record and pre-populating the request body with the current values,
        then change the fields you need to change.

        If you wish to update a smaller number of fields please use the [PATCH endpoint](partially-update-an-analysis.md).

      description: |-
        This endpoint provides the relevant ML features (based on feature importance testing) that are shown to impact 
        the demand for the Beam Analysis. These are the features you should take into your forecasting model to improve 
        your model accuracy.

        These values represent each group of features' statistical significance when it comes to impacting observable 
        incremental/decremental changes in demand.

        {% hint style="info" %}
        The easiest way to get these ML features from our Features API to be used in your models is by using the Beam 
        `analysis_id` in your Features API request.

      operationId: upload_demand_public_analyses__analysis_id__sink_post
      summary: Upload Demand Data
      description: |-
        Beam Analyses support daily or weekly demand data. The type of data is detected automatically on upload.

        For **daily** demand the minimum amount of data required is **6 months**, or 180 data points. Beam can impute up 
        to 20% of missing values, provided that the minimum data requirements are satisfied and there are no more than 7 
        consecutive days missing.

        For **weekly** demand the minimum amount of data required is **2 years**, or 104 data points. Beam can impute up 
        to 10% of missing values, provided that the minimum data requirements are satisfied and there are no more than 5 
        consecutive weeks missing. All weekly data points must align with the **start of the week** and occur on the 
        same weekday.

        All data points need to be between 2017-01-01 and one year into the future from today's date (today + 365 days).

        Uploading data replaces existing data for the same date. It's not currently possible to remove data for a 
        particular date. The idea with this endpoint is that you're continuously adding new demand data over time.

        {% hint style="info" %}
        The data can be uploaded in chunks, but the analysis data must remain valid at all times. If a newly uploaded 
        chunk renders the analysis data invalid (for example, by introducing a large gap between data points), the 
        chunk will be rejected, and the previously stored demand data will be preserved.

            Analyses can belong to multiple groups. Analyses must have the same demand type (the interval must match 
            and, for weekly analyses, week_start_day must also be consistent).
            Every analysis in the group must have the same industry, if set.

        Optionally, specify the minimum rank level to use when calculating event impacts.
        **We strongly recommend** not setting the rank levels and instead letting Beam define the best rank levels
        based on your industry.
